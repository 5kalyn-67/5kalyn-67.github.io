# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Steven Dang and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton] (http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    This lab was a very similar experience to Lab 5, except I was confident in my work and I knew exactly what to do. Pattern.cc was easy to follow directions on, and judge.cc was a challenge to get done. I learned about for loops in this lab and how they can be expressed. I remember that judge.cc finally worked when I was in the library, so I celebrated silently for it and pushed it. This lab was definitely my most proud work.

* Lab 9 Part 2

    This one was a real challenge to do since working with input and output files can get confusing. This one took a little bit of thinking, but I was able to get most of the test case results. The biggest lesson that I learned in this lab was how important it is to differentiate your error messages. By differentiating the error messages, logic errors can be more easily identified. There were a few error messages that I could not get to pop up, but it overall was a successful lab. This was also the lab where I got to work with Jashwant again, probably my favorite partner to have since we are both proficient at that point.

* Lab 5

    This lab was the first time I felt like I was programming. Beforehand, I felt like I did not understand C++, but this lab turned out to be easy for me to do. I found programming both parts to be relatively simple and got used to using data types and variables because of it. Another thing that I learned was a clear understanding of the make format and lint commands. I used to struggle interpreting them, but finally learned how to read them in this lab.
